Okay, so to be clear, disabling preemption here is strictly a
performance consideration, not a correctness one?

Given this response, I'm assuming that to be the case.

Disabling preemption to avoid "compromising performance", presumes a
very specific definition of "performance" that does not apply _in
general_, and certainly does not apply for RT users, who care more for
"response time" (as Steven put it).

Instead, the kernel already directly provides tools for _users_ to make
decisions about what the relative portions of their workloads are,
namely scheduling parameters, CPU affinities, isolcpus, etc.  Why are
these not sufficient in this case?

In addition, the use of local locks is a waste here, they provide more
guarantees than is actually necessary; this driver will function fine if
more than two threads on the same CPU are within this "critical
section".  If you want to maintain preempt_disable()/_enable() in
non-RT, then whatever, use the preempt_disable_nort()/_enable_nort()
varieties.
