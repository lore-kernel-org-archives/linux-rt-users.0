So there we go:

1) Without kernel options (except resume option) copying works in deskt=
op.

2) But then otherwise as I expected: With just "threadirqs" kernel opti=
on it=20
hangs. I would have suspected the "i915_enable_rc6" option instead.

3) But only when triggering copy via KDE desktop dolphin=C2=B4s file ma=
nager. I=20
tried copying on tty1 again and no hang there. Also again I/O seemed to=
 go on=20
after mouse pointer freeze (without Ctrl-Alt-F1) working. kwin ran in=20
compositing mode.

4) With just "i915_enable_rc6=3D7" it works. But since according to pow=
ertop=20
that option doesn=C2=B4t give me the benefit of doing into deeper GPU s=
leep states=20
anyway, I removed that one now as well.


So my laptop is on 3.13-rc6 now without any special options and I learn=
ed=20
again:

Never try to tune the kernel :)

And if still tuning it: First remove any kernel option when facing any =
issue.=20
Sorry for the noise that not adhering to this has caused.


This is second time that threadirqs option caused problems here. Thus C=
Cing=20
rt-users mailing list as well.

If wished I compile this all into a bugzilla.kernel.org bug report in a=
=20
concise format as well. But thats for another day :)

Have a good shift into new year if not already in it=E2=80=A6 otherwise=
 a happy new=20
year,
Martin
