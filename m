This is a series of commits that came about while researching a problem
on a preempt-rt kernel.  The RT problem seems tied to the function
jbd2_journal_commit_transaction, hence the common theme/location in
this series.

That said, it turns out that there is nothing in these commits that is
specific to RT, so they were reviewed with the aim to mainline them
(and also continue to research the RT problem...)

Once these have been placed in a non-rebased branch with fixed commit
IDs, I'll submit ext3/jbd versions of the same where appropriate.

Testing has involved ensuring jbd_debug still works (with the newly
documented non-debugfs module param) and also with a largely parallel
yocto build running concurrently with a large "rm -rf" (i.e. the test
that has been problematic on 3.4.x/3.6.x preempt-rt kernels).

Thanks,
Paul.
