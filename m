That statement is either misleading or wrong, but the actual behaviour
doesn't seem straightforward either.

My suggestion does seem to work here (I've used it in the past) but
it's probably best not to rely on it unnecessarily...  One would
have to read the gas code and get the docs fixed first.

... here I'd agree: it doesn't seem justified relying on dubious
tricks here, since there's doubt about whether my suggestion is
really safe.

You could try $RANDOM for inspiration.

Nested macro use is rare, but a scheme with only 10 possible random
numbers seems a little too optiimstic -- and in practice people don't
always remember to grep when adding new ones.

9999, 8888, 1111 and 2222 are already taken even without this patch.
