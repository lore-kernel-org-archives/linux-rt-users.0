I don't think it's an ext4/jdb2 problem.

And that's what you need to investigate.

The rest of the threads being stuck waiting for the journal writeback
or inode->sem are just the consequence of it and have nothing to do
with the root cause of the problem.

ftrace with the block/writeback/jdb/ext4/sched tracepoints enabled
should provide a first insight into the issue.
