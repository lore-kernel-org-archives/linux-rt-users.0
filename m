Mention that neither patchup sequence is allowed to use section-changing
directives?

For example:

	if_will_cond_yield_neon
		// some code

		.pushsection .rodata, "a"
foo: 			.quad // some literal data for some reason
		.popsection

		// some code
	do_cond_yield_neon

is not safe, because .previous is now .rodata.

(You could protect against this with
	.pushsection .text; .previous; .subsection 1; // ...
	.popsection
but it may be overkill.)

Can we at least drop a BUILD_BUG_ON() somewhere to check this?

Maybe in kernel_neon_begin() since this is intimately kernel-mode NEON
related.

A comment that we will fall through to 6666f here may be helpful.

Could have slightly more random "random" labels here, but otherwise
it looks ok to me.

I might go through and replace all the random labels with something
more robust sometime, but I've never been sure it was worth the
effort...
