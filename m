Well, the point is that the JBD write out is not completed. The above
is just the consequence. So really looking at ext4 inode write backs
and something stuck on BJ_Shadow or the inode sem is the wrong
place. It's all just caused by the JDB writeout not being completed
for whatever reason.

I fear that this is just papering over the problem, but you have to
talk to the jbd2 folks about that.

I personally prefer a reasonable explanation for the current behaviour
rather than a magic "solution" to the problem. But that's up to you.
