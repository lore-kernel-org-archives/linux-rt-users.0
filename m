The motivation for the preempt manipulation has nothing to do with the counter.

The buffer allocation returns a set of ringed write-combining 64B MMIO buffers.   The allocate lock is then dropped right after allocation to allow parallel allocates.

The hardware keeps track of the buffer fill across multiple CPUs, so that after the oldest buffer is copied the ring is advanced.

The idea was to minimize the time from the drop of the allocate lock to the end of the copy to insure the highest rate of copy to the ring from multiple cores.

The counter exists purely as a hot path optimization to avoid an atomic.

The only time an accurate counter is required is during reset sequences to wait for allocate/copy pairs to finish and we don't care if the closing decrement is on the same core.

The percpu refcount might be a better choice, but I don't think it existed at the time the code was written.

That would certainly be the easiest solution, but would compromise performance if a migration occurs after the allocate lock is dropped.

We have been looking at the patch that was submitted for using the raw spin lock and we share Arnaldo's concern, particularly mixing lock types.

Other locks can be procured in the timeout case in sc_wait_for_packet_egress() inside queue_work() and dd_dev_err()/printk().
