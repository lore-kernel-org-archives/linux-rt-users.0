local_lock() disables migration. It's currently only in the -rt patch.
It's made to allow preemption to occur as much as possible, as -rt
cares about reaction time more than performance (although, we would
love to keep performance as well).

A raw_spin_lock sacrifices reaction time, which goes against the goal
of -rt. When PREEMPT_RT is disabled, the local_lock becomes
preempt_disable, so it has no affect on the vanilla kernel.
