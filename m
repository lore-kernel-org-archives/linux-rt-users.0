Thanks, I wasn't aware of the "-i" -- and had simply been using
gdb directly with "l *jbd2_journal_commit_transaction+0x<offset>"
which shows what inline we were in, but it still wasn't clear to me
yet what was going on, that we were stuck there.

That was one reason -- the other is that I was thinking if sensible
functional boundaries in the source could be made between the
chunks marked as phase 1 --> phase N, then people like me who
are new to reading that bit of code might come away feeling more
confident that they understood it correctly.  Anyway, it was just a
thought...

I will keep people posted as to what (if?) I finally figure out
about RT+jbd2.  I have reproduced it on a completely different
machine (dual socket numa xeon with dual disks as raid0, vs.
the original single disk, single socket, COTS dell optiplex).

It still takes a massively parallel yocto build, combined with a
large "rm -rf" elsewhere to trigger it though (and even multiple
tries of the above).  So it is hard to say with confidence that
it is "found and fixed" based on build results alone -- when 5
full yocto builds can pass w/o any issue at all.  :(

But thanks for the input though!
Paul.
