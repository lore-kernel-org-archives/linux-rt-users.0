I've seen roughly the same drop in my testing.  In my case it had to do with the
nature of how work is done using virt-dma.  The virt-dma is predicated on only
letting one transaction be active at a time and it increases the latency for
getting the next transaction off.  For large transactions, it's negligible.  But
for small transactions, it is pretty evident.

I'd expect the locking to not be the source of the problem, especially with
your use case.
