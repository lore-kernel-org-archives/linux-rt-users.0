No, it's a clean fix for the problem.  The main issue is that what the
jbd2 commit was doing was starting inode writeback for those blocks
needed to guarantee data=ordered mode (so this is what caused various
pages to have writeback page set) as well as starting metadata writes
to the commit (which is what caused the shadow bit to be set on the
metadata buffers). 

Now that we clear the shadow flag when the metadata writes is
complete, the writeback will eventually be allowed to complete and
this prevents the deadlock.
