I did a quick scan of architectures and looked at the various cmpxchg
implementations.  Assuming that __HAVE_ARCH_CMPXCHG really means "this
architecture implements a native cmpxchg which is faster than the
generic implementation", I put what I found in the following table; note
that I'm not 100% confident these are correct, as in some instances I
had to make a judgement call as to whether the implementation is "fast",
hopefully it's still useful :).

1: Conditional on CONFIG_ARC_HAS_LLSC
2: SMP not a supported configuration
3: No cmpxchg() implementation at all?
4: Conditional on CONFIG_RMW_INSNS
5: Conditional on CONFIG_MN10300_HAS_ATOMIC_OPS_UNIT
6: SMP not supported?  Uses generic cmpxchg.
7: Should use generic cmpxchg/cmpxchg_local?  Setting __HAVE_ARCH_CMPXCHG a bug?

Looks like there are a few arch-specific conditionals that might need to
be worked out for arc, m68k, and mn10300; but this could potentially
work.

If we don't go down that route, we should probably at least add
__HAVE_ARCH_CMPXCHG for arm64, blackfin (on SMP), frv, mips, tile, and
xtensa as well.
