It appears that EXT4_I(inode)->i_data_sem is involved, so I wonder if it 
might have something to do with the fact that the RT patches modify the 
reader-writer semaphores so that the read-side is exclusive?

I suspect I won't have time to isolate a useful testcase, unfortunately.

For what it's worth, we initially discovered the problem when copying 
large (10GB) files from an NFS client onto an NFS-mounted ext4 
filesystem that was mounted with "noatime,nodiratime,data=ordered". 
Initially it failed quite reliably, then something in our environment 
changed and it became more intermittent (could take several hours of 
stress test to reproduce).

We discovered somewhat by accident that we could more reliably reproduce 
it running on a pair of VirtualBox VMs.  The server exported the 
filesystem as per above, and on the client I just used dd to copy from 
/dev/zero to the NFS-mounted filesystem.  Generally it would hang before 
copying 5GB of data.
