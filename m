Fair enough. I incorporated the check here so it disappears from the code en=
tirely when !CONFIG_PREEMPT, because otherwise, you end up with a sequence t=
hat is mispredicted every # iterations without any benefit.
I guess i could macroise that separately though.

Agreed.

Perhaps not. And i have not made any attempts yet to benchmark at great deta=
il, given that i need some feedback from the rt crowd first whether this is l=
ikely to work as desired.

This is not an offset in that regard, but the header that defines it is not a=
sm safe
