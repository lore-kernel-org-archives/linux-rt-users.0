Well, if the resulting patch causes jbd_debug() messages to be issued
correctly, I have every confidence that they won't be interleaved; the
%pV structure was used to solve this very problem, and it's used all
over the kernel.  In fact we've used it __ext4_error()/ext4_error() to
solve this exact same issue of interleaved messages.

Ah, I missed that since I had been focusing on the jbd_debug().
That's a good catch, we'll still need this patch to make sure we're
checking the state assert under the j_state lock.  But with the fixed
jbd_debug() we can keep the jbd_debug() statement outside of the
j_state_lock critical region.
