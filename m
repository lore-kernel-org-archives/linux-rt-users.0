Ah, I get you.  I had convinced myself that there was only post-
patchup code.

So you conceptually want something like

if_will_cond_yield_neon
        // pre-yield patchup code
do_cond_yield_neon
        // post-yield patchup code
endif_yield_neon

.macro if_will_cond_yield_neon
        // do preempt_count =3D=3D 1 && TIF_NEED_RESCHED check
        b.wont_yield 3432f
.endm

.macro do_cond_yield_neon
        bl      kernel_neon_end
        bl      kernel_neon_begin
.endm

.macro endif_yield_neon
3432:
.endm

The main difference I see is that this doesn't get the slow-case
code out of line.

Or have I still missed something?
