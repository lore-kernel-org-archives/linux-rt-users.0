Based on measurements the EFI functions get_variable /
get_next_variable take up to 2us. The functions get_time, set_time take
around 10ms. Those 10ms are too much. Even one ms would be too much.
The funny part is that EFI is invoked with enabled interrupts.
According to my tracing I see the interrupt almost 10ms later which
indicates that EFI is disabling interrupts while doing its thing.

This was observed on "EFI v2.60 by SoftIron Overdrive 1000". I don't say
that every EFI implementation does this but given that it has to access a
slow bus like I2C/SPI it is expected.

Disable EFI's RTC driver on RT.
