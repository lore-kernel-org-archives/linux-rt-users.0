Sure, I will do so tomorrow -  but since it can't be reproduced
on-demand, all I'll be able to do is to watch for independent
calls with very close time stamps, and confirm they were not
interleaved.

What about the state assert being done outside of the state
lock?   Should I keep that as a separate patch so that the
assert isn't checking what could possibly be a transient value?

Thanks,
Paul.
