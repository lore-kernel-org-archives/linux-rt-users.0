  Hum, this sounds familiar... I was already debugging this with RT kernel
and I also remember it was RT specific issue. Let me try to remember the
whole story... yes, while wandering over the traces I think I remember what
was the problem: In standard kernel, whenever we scheduler process out from
CPU, we unplug its IO queue in sched_submit_work(). However in RT kernel
that was not the case. So it could happen that a process has IOs queued
and was sent to sleep waiting for jbd2 thread to free some journal space
and jbd2 thread was waiting for some IO to complete - however that never
happened because the IO was sitting in the sleeping process' queue.

>From a quick look into the traces you've provided this seems to be your
case as well. I think newer RT kernels should have the bug fixed but I
wasn't really watching closely after I handed over the problem to RT folks.
