Thanks for the explanation.

A few questions:

1) Is this something that could hit mainline as well, or just the RT kernel?

2) If it can hit mainline, is this something that should be considered 
for the various longterm-support kernels?  (3.10, maybe 3.4)

3) For 3.4, do you think that it's sufficient to backport the three 
commits I mentioned, or are you aware of others that I should be looking 
at as well?
