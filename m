You cannot extrapolate from these numbers. If the lack of worst case
guarantees on an EFI system is a problem for -rt, the only meaningful
course of action is to disable EFI runtime services entirely.

I think SetVariable() may be even worse than GetTime(), given that NOR
flash updates may involve erasing blocks.

Yes, and this is also highly implementation specific. Basing this kind
of policy on a single implementation is not very wise imo.

Other calls to GetTime() would still be permitted in this case, so
this seems like a partial solution (although no other calls seem to
exist atm)
