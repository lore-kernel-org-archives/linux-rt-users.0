Sure, no worries.

I've changed my mind a bit about .altmacro, in that it is not really
usable at all unless turned on explicitly, and then off again, only
where it's needed.  So if you just assume it's always off, things are
sane (and that's what happens in practice).

But it's not really needed here -- my main confusion was with the
deeply nested .ifs, but perhaps that could be avoided more
straightforwardly:

	.if	\regcount > 1
	\op\()p	x19, x20, [sp, #16]
	.endif
	.if	\regcount > 3
	\op\()p	x21, x22, [sp, #32]
	.endif
	// ...
	.if	\regcount > 9
	\op\()p	x27, x28, [sp, #80]
	.endif

	.if	\regcount == 1
	\op\()r	x19, [sp, #20]
	.endif
	.if	\regcount == 3
	\op\()r	x21, [sp, #22]
	.endif
	// ...
	.if	\regcount == 9
	\op\()r	x27, [sp, #28]
	.endif


One other thing, should you be protecting the macro args with ()?

It seems unlikely that an expression would be passed for regcount,
but for extra it's a bit more plausible.
