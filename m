That should be OK.  We do allow a new transactions while we are
committing an older transaction, and if this requires more space, a
checkpoint could start.  I'm not sure why you're apparently seeing a
deadlock under RT-linux, though.

Instead of breaking it up, can you just use addr2line, i.e.:

% addr2line -a ffffffff8046a067 -i -e vmlinux  
0xffffffff8046a067
./include/linux/buffer_head.h:287
./fs/ext4/inode.c:5585
./fs/ext4/inode.c:5963

I find this to be incredibly useful, since with the -i option it will
handle inline functions correctly.  In the above example there are two
levels of inlining, one explicitly marked inline in
include/linux/buffer.h, and one implicit inlining taking place because
we had a static function in fs/ext4/inode.c that was only called by
one caller.

Because of gcc's implicit inlining, just breaking up the function by
itself wouldn't be enough, unless you explicitly marked the new static
functions with noinline; but that introduces inefficiencies.  If the
only reason you want to do this is to make it easier to figure out a
stack trace, addr2line really is your friend....
