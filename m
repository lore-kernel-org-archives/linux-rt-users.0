I'll definitely respin them and retest today, so no need for you to
bother manually dealing with the two trivial ones independently.

Thanks!

Good to know.  I'll keep it in mind to try some performance tests on
a jbd[2] converted non-RT kernel when I have time.  I expect with the
advent of hlist_bl_head we'll see more and more users of bit_spin,
but at least those ones can be "fixed" all in one place for RT.
