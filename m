Yes, it could hit the mainline as well.  It's more about the workload
and how the files are written to and/or sync'ed.

Yes, probably.

No, those three commits would be quite sufficient.  If you could
handle doing the backports, I would greatly appreciate it!  Sounds
like you've done so for 3.4 already, and it should be fairly
straightforward to get them into 3.10, since b34090e landed in 3.11.
