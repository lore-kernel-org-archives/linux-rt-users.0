Oh boy. I disable EFI entirely because then the bootloader won't boot
due to missing efi-stub. But I could disable the runtime-wrappers if
that is what you meant. Patch below.

Here we go. "Read" can be triggered from userland via sysfs / efivars.
"Write" is (currently) limited to pstore?

even if interrupts were not disabled then there would be no context
switch on exit from interrupt path due to the preempt-disable part. So
no improvement.

I *assumed* pstore would use the SetVariable during warning/bug. The
pstore thingy might be useful. Not sure.

Subject: [PATCH RT] arm64: Disable EFI runtime services on RT

Based on meassurements the EFI functions get_variable /
get_next_variable take up to 2us which looks okay.
The functions get_time, set_time take around 10ms. Those 10ms are too
much. Even one ms would be too much.
Ard mentioned that SetVariable might even trigger larger latencies if
the firware will erase flash blocks on NOR.

The time-functions are used by efi-rtc and can be triggered during
runtimed (either via explicit read/write or ntp sync).

The variable write could be used by pstore.
These functions can be disabled without much of a loss. The poweroff /
reboot hooks will be provided by PSCI.

Disable EFI's runtime wrappers.

This was observed on "EFI v2.60 by SoftIron Overdrive 1000".
