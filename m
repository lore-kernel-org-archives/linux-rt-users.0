Indeed. The changelog does not look like a bug fix. That's why I was
worried about Chris 'magic resolution' report.

We've seen that before. RT indeed makes race conditions more prominent
by opening way more race windows than a mainline kernel ever does.

But there is a caveat. With the recent per cpu assumptions RT might
very well run into some completely not mainline relevant RT specific
pitfalls. And that's becoming worse with every day that RT is out of
tree. But that's a totally different story.

Thanks again for your profound analysis of the issue at hand!
